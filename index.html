        <h1>Staircase Program</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this program is to send recently deceased people to deep space.</p>
        <p>This program is inspired from the staircase program in the 3 body problem series by Liu Cixin.</p>


        <h2>Target velocities</h2>
        <p>Let us assume the destination of the payload (the body placed in a coffin) is the Alpha Centuri, the closest star system. The three escape velocities are:</p>

        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>$G$ is the gravitational constant</li>
            <li>$M_E$ is the mass of Earth</li>
            <li>$R_E$ is the radius of Earth</li>
            <li>$v_o$ is Earth's orbital velocity around the Sun (about 29.8 km/s)</li>
            <li>$M_g$ is the mass of the Milky Way galaxy</li>
            <li>$r$ is the distance from the galactic center</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Payload</h2>
        <p>The payload is a space coffin containing and the body of the person and some personal belongings. A rough estimation of mass of the payload is 250 kg (150 kg body + objects, 100 kg the coffin).</p>

        <h2>Trajectory</h2>
        <p>Given the current state propulsion, the best solution to escape the solar system gravity is to use gravitational slingshot (just like Voyager 1). </p>
        <p>The take-off should occur on Earth, because there is no launch base on the Moon.</p>

        <h2>Acceleration constrains</h2>
        <p>The acceleration during take-off must be limited to preserve the integrity of the body. The typical acceleration of a habitable mission is 3 to 5 g.</p>

        <h2>Journey monitoring</h2>
        <p>The relatives of the customer must be provided a online monitoring of the coffin. It's approximate location, it's relative speed, and during the early stage of the journey, a live stream of the flight provided by Starlink.</p>
